# Link Sanitizer
## Description
Some shared URLs are poisoned with a source identifiers, allowing the owner of the site to create links between people. If you are a bit consious about your privacy, you may already remove them manually. This plugin is here to simplify and automate this "URL cropping" (both when clicking on it and sharing it).
For example, clicking on [https://youtu.be/qOi4Ao40IYA?si=dummySI] would be reduce to [https://youtu.be/qOi4Ao40IYA]. If you where to click on the "Share" button on YouTube, it should give you the clean URL again, so that the not-privacy-driven URL doesn't even appear on your screen.
